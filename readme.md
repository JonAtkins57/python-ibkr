# IBKR Wheel Automation

This repo automates a weekly options wheel strategy using Interactive Brokers (IBKR) API.
It executes cash-secured puts (CSPs) and covered calls (CCs) using a defined ruleset.

## ðŸ§  Strategy Summary

- Sell **cash-secured puts** (CSPs) every Monday on tickers like `TSLL`, `F`, `SNAP`, and `OLO`
- If assigned, sell **covered calls** the following Monday
- Only trade options that yield **â‰¥2% weekly ROI**
- Skip low-liquidity or invalid contracts
- Trades are placed automatically through the IBKR API
- Tracks filled & rejected trades with logging
